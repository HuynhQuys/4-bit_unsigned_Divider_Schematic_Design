# 4-bit_unsigned_Divider_Schematic_Design

**Tools:** Cadence Virtuoso

**Description:**
- Designed a 4-bit unsigned divider based on the Restoring Division Algorithm.
- Implemented transistor-level schematic using fundamental logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, Inverter), Full Adders, and Multiplexers.
- Built Processing Unit (PU) block and integrated into the full divider schematic.
- Performed functional simulation on Cadence Virtuoso to verify division results with multiple testcases.
- Achieved correct outputs for quotient and remainder across all test scenarios.
- Final design consists of ~1024 transistors (512 PMOS, 512 NMOS) with measured delay analysis.
